            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Slide Mountain, Catskills</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 17, 2016</p>
            <p>Where will we play? Was one of the important questions we asked ourselves as we considered moving from the outdoor paradise of Utah to not-quite-sure-what-to-expect-but-lots-of-people-and-no-mountains Long Island for my postdoc position at Stony Brook University. What kind of hiking will there be? Can we go trail running? Are there even trails there? What about camping, skiing, biking, and fishing? Many of the things we loved about living in the American west, not just Utah, but also Oregon where Sarah grew up and I lived from 2004 to 2011, would suddenly be absent from our lives (or at least more challenging to access). Moving to New York was going to bring lots of changes for us, and much of it wanted, but we also knew we'd be missing out on some of what makes us happiest, being outside and away from the crowds and traffic of modern life.</p>
            <p>After moving into our home near the university we began to explore our surroundings. We arrived early in the summer and it was hot and humid (so, so humid). We heard a lot about the beaches and decided to get after some sand and surf. It didn't take us long to fall in love with the beaches on Long Island. Our first beach day was at Robert Moses State Park on Fire Island and it was awesome, swimming in the Atlantic on a hot summer day is about as refreshing as it gets. Shortly after we ventured further east to the Hamptons and had another great day (except for the traffic on the return home). The sandy beach was beautiful, the swimming was fun, and lazing on the beach fantastic. As great as the beaches are (north shore beaches are pretty good too), we needed to get away from the crowds and into the more familiar arena of hiking. Fortunately, the Catskills are not too far away for us weekend warriors, so we picked a hike and headed upstate in mid-August.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Our first trip took us to Slide Mountain, the highest peak in the Catskills at 4,180 ft. For reference, the valley floor of Salt Lake City sits at 4,500 ft. and the peaks in the Wasatch outside SLC rise above 10,000 ft. So Slide Mountain was going to be something a little different than we're used to, but I went with an open mind and the desire to explore.</p>

                <h4>Do we miss them? Yeah, we miss them.</h4>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The Slide Mountain trailhead has ample parking under a canopy of beautiful hardwood forest. We decided to follow a recommended <a href="http://www.nynjtc.org/hike/slide-mountain-highest-peak-catskills-loop">route</a> that is longer to the top but more interesting and scenic, rather than the straight climb to the summit. It was a hot, humid day with heat indices in the city soaring above 100, and although it was much cooler in the Catskills, the forest felt like a sauna and moisture from recent rain showers really made the forest feel tropical. Everything was a lush green and the sweet forest air a treat to breathe in. The maple and birch were splendid and the spruce forest at higher elevation was really beautiful. Fortunately, I love the forest and the hike through the woods provided plenty of scenery for me, because there weren't many scenic viewpoints. There are some nice overlooks but they've mostly had foliage grow up and block the view as described in the trail guide. Just below the summit, however, there's a nice view of the surrounding mountains and another just past the summit. The summit itself doesn't have any views, just the remnants of an old fire tower.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The loop we traveled was rumored to be less popular than straight up and down and I'd say this was true, before getting to the main up/down route we ran into just two other groups of hikers. The route down followed the more popular trail and we saw about 10 other groups of hikers, so the trail was in no way crowded but the longer loop even less so. This was great for us and made us thankful we had made the effort to get out hiking. Being on the trail was such a relief, a stress reducer, and provided fresh perspective on our time in New York. The Catskills are beautiful and I'm really looking forward to returning for the Autumn colors, a northeast spectacle that Sarah has yet to witness in person.</p>
            <p>Our trip to Slide Mountain inspired us to plan more trips to the Catskills and beyond to the Adirondacks. We also plan to explore parks along the Hudson that are a little closer to home: Harriman, Bear Mountain, and Hudson Highlands to start. I can hardly wait until the weekend!</p>
            <p>The story isn't complete without mention of Frankie, the Beagle/Foxhound mix that we recently adopted. This was her first big hike and she was a champ. Here she is in bed after a long day on the trail.</p>
