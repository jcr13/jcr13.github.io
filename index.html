            <h3>ACS Spring Meeting in NOLA</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">ACS is a huge meeting, and it's 
                tough to see all the talks that look interesting, but I
                listened some interesting talks, took in the COMP division
                posters, wandered around the exposition, and toured the French
                Quarter at night. Absolutely fell in love with New Orleans.</p>
            <h3>NIH K99/R00 Grant Writing Workshop</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Pathway to Independence. Sounds
                like the way to go, right? The NIH K99/R00 provide mentored
                support for postdoctoral scholars and help the awardee
                transition to independent research by providing 3 years of
                funding once the postdoc starts their own lab. I left the
                workshop feeling inspired to write a proposal and hopeful
                that I could be successful if I followed some solid practical
                advice.</p>
            <h3>Lab Manual Review Committee at Suffolk County Community 
                College</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">I will be working with faculty
                and staff at SCCC this semester to review and revise the 
                laboratory manuals for their General Chemistry sequence. 
                This is a mentored experience through my IRACDA fellowship.
                I'm looking forward to being part of this process and doing
                what we can to improve curriculum.</p>
            <h3>Teaching General Chemistry at SUNY Old Westbury</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">I am instructor of record for
                Principles of Chemistry II at SUNY Old Westbury for the
                Spring 2018 semester. I have a class of 45 students and 
                can't wait to get classroom experience. This great
                opportunity is possible through my IRACDA postdoctoral
                fellowship.</p>

            <h3>Guest Lecture for Physical and Quantitative Biology</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">I lectured on Protein Folding and 
                Stability for the Laufer Center's PQB graduate course.</p>
            <h3>Share Your Science Course Completed</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Scientific American, The Alan Alda 
                Center for Communicating Science, and the Kavli Foundation 
                created a science communication course to train scientists
                to engage with the public through writing blogs and other 
                informal writing. I was part of the first cohort to take the 
                course, and hope to share one or two of the pieces I worked
                on during the course.</p>
            <h3>NSF XSEDE Startup Allocation Awarded</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Postdocs can be PIs on XSEDE startup 
                allocations, so I wrote a proposal to use the XStream computer 
                at Stanford to run a deep learning algorithm for predicting 
                protein contacts from sequence. This is in collaboration with 
                Daniel Blibaum, an undergraduate in the Dill lab.</p>
            <h3>Vacation</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Back in southern Oregon for a week to 
                visit family. Had a great time on a multi-day rafting trip on 
                the Wild and Scenic Section of the Rogue River.</p>

            <h3>Our new NCSA Blue Waters allocation "Protein Structure 
                Prediction" begins August 1st.</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">We have been awarded over 5M hours of 
                computer time on this NSF resource. Blue Waters is vital to our 
                research because it has thousands of GPUs, which we use to run 
                MELD, atomistic physics-based simulations of protein 
                folding.</p>
            <h3>"Scientists Teaching Science" course completed</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">I finished "Scientists Teaching 
                Science", an online course in best practices in science 
                education, based on the latest research on teaching and 
                learning. This course really helped me improve my Teaching 
                Statement, and I wrote a syllabus for a General Chemistry 
                course, just two of the benefits from this course.</p>
            <h3>Teaching at Suffolk County Community College Fall 2017</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">I'll be helping Dr. Candice Foley 
                with her CH 133 General Chemistry course this fall. This is an 
                opportunity to teach at an IRACDA partner institution. I look 
                forward to working with Dr. Foley to deliver great chemistry 
                lessons to students at SCCC.</p>
            <h3>O Canada!</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Early in the year I learned that I am 
                a Canadian citizen due to recent changes in law (long story but 
                essentially I became eligible for citizenship since I have a 
                parent that was born in Canada), and I'm in the process of 
                applying for proof of citizenship from the Canadian government.  
                I was born in the US, but I'm looking forward to duel 
                citizenship! Every few years my extended family gathers on 
                Manitoulin Island and this year the reunion was on Canada Day 
                and Canada's 150th. Here's looking towards a rising sun over 
                the North Channel of Lake Huron.</p>

            <h3>Simons Summer Research Fellow in the Dill Lab</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">Jennifer Pan, a Simons Summer 
                Research Fellow, and high school student from Irvine, CA will 
                work in the lab for six weeks studying thermodynamics and 
                kinetics of protein G using MELD simulations.</p>
            <h3>Southampton Writing Workshops</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">The CIE at SBU sponsors an academic 
                writing retreat each year in Southampton, at Stony Brook's 
                campus on the east end of Long Island. I organized two 
                workshops: <b>Style & Process</b> and <b>Writing Your 
                    Manuscript, Dissertation, or Grant</b> for the retreat. I 
                also took the opportunity to work on a couple of manuscripts 
                that I have in progress. We kicked off the retreat with a 
                cruise around Shinnecock Bay on an SBU research vessel.</p>
            <h3>IRACDA 2017 Conference in Birmingham, AL</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">This was a great conference in 
                Birmingham, where I attended a number of workshops, seminars, 
                and science talks. I met other IRACDA scholars from around the 
                country and presented a poster on my research into folding 
                nonthreadable proteins with MELD.</p>

            <h3>Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science Bootcamp</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">The CIE at SBU organized a full day 
                of Alda Center workshops including <b>Improv for Scientists</b> 
                and <b>Distilling Your Message</b>. This was a fun day of 
                learning how to communicate better as scientists.</p>
            <h3>CIE Alumni Career Panel</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">It was inspiring to hear what IRACDA

                networking, and spending time away from the computer in nearby 
                Old Field, NY.</p>
            <h3>Implicit Bias: An Obstacle to Achieving Diversity Webinar</h3>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">I attended this webinar presented by 
                the National Postdoctoral Association to learn more about 
                solving the problem of under-representation, especially in 
                STEM.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">A great benefit of the IRACDA program 
                is that the CIE arranges a series of pedagogy workshops led by 
                experts from the Stony Brook community. The Fall 2016 - Winter 
                2017 workshops included the following:

                education. I presented on this paper from the Tanner group that 
                shows that the affective domain is key in learning (in addition 
                to cognitive and metacognitive) and concludes that monitoring

                <p class="blog-post-meta">We identified a new binding site on 
                LSD1 through ensemble-based virtual screening, and confirmed by 
                X-ray crystallography. The ensembles were generated by 
                molecular dynamics simulations, and we showed that the static 
                X-ray structure was not enough to predict the binding site, but 
                that structures from the MD ensemble sampled conformations 
                compatible with the ligand. We also identified other potential 
                binding hot spots.
