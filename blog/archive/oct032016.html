            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Staying Current in Science</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 3, 2016</p>
            <p>It's important to stay up to date with the literature, but that's not easy to do with so much information out there. Fortunately a lot of journals have options to get email alerts about new content, so that the information comes to you rather than having to go look for it. I try to take advantage of this as much as possible. The emails come in, I can read them when I want, then when I have time follow up on interesting articles. It's important to know what's the latest research in your field, so that you can place your own work in the context of others, and to read to find inspiration and new ideas. My approach is to look at information from a variety of sources; peer-reviewed journals, blogs, and social media. Here I highlight some of the journals I keep my eye on, and where else I look for the latest in science.</p>
            <h3>Journals</h3>
            <p>There are a handful of ACS journals that I try to stay current with.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Journal of the American Chemical Society</li>
                <li>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation</li>
                <li>Journal of Physical Chemistry B</li>
                <li>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course I enjoy skimming through Science and Nature every week. Even if I don't find articles with direct relevance to my work there's almost always some interesting science to read about. The editorials or career stories are also content I typically enjoy. Cell and PNAS are also great, PNAS typically has more content relevant to me, but Cell is interesting so I browse the contents.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Science</li>
                <li>Nature</li>
                <li>Proceedings of the National Academy of Science</li>
                <li>Cell</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since I'm interested in structural biology and biophysical chemistry I try to stay current with the following journals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Structure</li>
                <li>Nature Structural and Molecular Biology</li>
                <li>Biophysical Journal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides the others listed above I try to follow journals with computational chemistry research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Journal of Computational Chemistry</li>
                <li>PLoS Computational Biology</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And then there are a number of other journals that keep me up to date with topics including drug discovery and nucleic acid research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nucleic Acid Research</li>
                <li>Nature Review Drug Discovery</li>
                <li>Journal of Chemical Physics</li>
                <li>Nature Chemistry</li>
                <li>Drug Discovery Today</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm not suggesting that I read all of these journals but I do try to skim the TOC or receive email alerts from all of them and then follow up on articles that look interesting. This is an incomplete list and continually evolving as my research interests shift.</p>
            <h3>Blogs</h3>
            <p>There are some great blogs out there that provide interesting takes on the latest in science, provide historical content, and often provoke comments that are worth reading. This is a list of ones I find worthwhile, and there are probably many more depending on your specific areas of interest. Look around and explore, you may be surprised to find some very good science writing out there.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Pipeline</li>
                <li>The Curious Wavefunction</li>
                <li>NIH Director's Blog</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are a few more blogs/news sites that I check on a regular basis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The blogs at Nature.com</li>
                <li>The main page for Science mag (formerly known as ScienceInsider, I think)</li>
                <li>Chemistry and Engineering News from ACS (C&EN)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Social Media</h3>
            <p>I follow a lot of scientists and science-related content on Facebook and Twitter. In the past I made lists on Twitter to keep track of who I was following in these categories but I've neglected to update the lists in a long time. Science journals use social media to highlight important articles, parody accounts can provide comic relief, and by following other scientists you can get great insight into how they think and use social media to get their message out. A couple of my favorite Twitter accounts are @AcademicsSay and @ChemProfCramer, but there are many more.</p>
            <p>There are other important ways to stay up to date. Nothing beats going to a conference and seeing what people are excited about, and talking with people in your field to see what they are up to. Being in an environment with a rich research community is also nice, it's much easier to find out what's going on when you can just talk about it with coworkers and colleagues, but I guess not everyone has that luxury. Staying current with literature and scientific trends can be time-consuming but an important part of research is knowing what others are doing and being connected to the research community.</p>
