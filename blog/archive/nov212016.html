            <h2 class="blog-post-title">IRACDA Journal Club: The Role of Affect in Learning</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 21, 2016</p>
            <p>Once a month the IRACDA scholars at Stony Brook University gather to discuss an article for our pedagogy journal club. Topics since Justne, when I arrived and began my postdoc, have included active learning, POGIL, and flipped classrooms.</p>
            <p>The journal club is an opportunity to discuss research into teaching undergraduate STEM courses. Some of the IRACDA scholars have already finished their two sememsters of teaching experience, ohters are currently teaching, and some, including me, will be teaching next year. Coming together allows everyon to discuss the articles and how it relates to their different experiences. It also serves to get all of the IRACDA scholars together on a regular basis, a small miracle with everyone's busy schedules.</p>
            <p>Although I haven't begun my teaching commitments I have previously given some lectures and TA'd for a semester in graduate school. I'm also currently helping with the Physical and Quantitative Biology graduate course at the Laufer Center at SBU. I gave three lectures for that course and I've been leading weekly recitations, writing and grading homework, and will be writing and grading the final exam. I am gaining experience in teaching and look forward to more next fall when I pair up with SUNY Old Westbury, Brooklyn College, or Suffolk County Community College to get more experience as part of my IRACDA fellowship.</p>
            <p>It's early in my teaching career and I'm sure my experiences will change my outlook as I grow and spend more time in my role as an instructure. At this point, thoug, I wanted to look for articless that examined an are of teaching that I hadn't considered much and that would also lead to good discussion in the journal club. I chose Gloriana Trujillo and Kimberly D. Tanner's 2014 article from CBE Life Sciences "Considering the Role of Affect in Learning: Monitoring Students' Self-Efficacy, Sense of Belonging, and Science Identity".</p>
            <p>The primary thesis of the article is that affect is key to learning and that research into this is still in the early phases so new methods are needed to understand how affective constructes like self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and science identity are realted to student outcomes.</p>
            <p>The authors define the three affective constructs, demonstrate the importance of each on learning, and then provide examples of how different asessments have been used to study the role of each in learning. I followed a similar outline for my talk.</p>
            <p>I don't intend to go over all the details here, but essentially each of these affective construtcts have been shown to be associated with improved outcomes and persistence in the field. In short, students that have belief in themselves, feel that they belong in science, and develop identity as a scientist perform better and are more likely to stay in their discipline.</p>
            <p>There are, of course, a number of things that influence self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and science identity. For self-efficacy, social persuasion (encouragement from others) and vicarious learning (learning from watching others) seem most important. As instructors encourage your students and show them how it is done. Stereotype threat negatively impacts both sense of belonging and development of science identity.</p>
