            <h2 class="blog-post-title">IRACDA Journal Club: The Role of Affect in Learning</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 21, 2016</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, not everyone feels comfortable in a STEM classroom. A variety of factors, such as stereotype threat, contribute to students' having low self-efficacy, feeling disengaged and without a sense of belonging, and failing to adopt a science identity. The tragedy is that students' that leave science do so because they reject the culture, not because they are less competent or talented than those that persist.</p>
            <p>These ideas led me to Gloriana Trujillo and Kimberly D. Tanner's 2014 article from CBE Life Sciences "Considering the Role of Affect in Learning: Monitoring Students' Self-Efficacy, Sense of Belonging, and Science Identityity". I decided to discuss this article for the November IRACDA journal club.</p>
            <p>Once a month the IRACDA scholars at Stony Brook University gather to discuss an article for our pedagogy journal club. Topics since June, when I arrived and began my postdoc, have included improvement in undergraduate biology outcomes with increased structure and active learning, Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) in a physical chemistry course, and the role of pre-class preparation in flipped classrooms.</p>
            <p>The journal club is an opportunity to discuss research into teaching undergraduate STEM courses. As IRACDA scholars, each of us will have the opportunity to teach for two semesters at one of three local partner institutions: Brooklyn College, SUNY Old Westbury, or Suffolk County Community College. The Center for Inclusive Education (CIE) at Stony Brook manages the IRACDA program and, in addition to hosting journal club (and making everything we do possible), the CIE organizes a series of pedagogy workshops and enrolls us in a Scientists Teaching Science course. As IRACDA scholars, we benefit from training in pedagogy, and extensive in class experience as instructors, and are better prepared to teach than typical postdocs who focus primarily on developing their research.</p>
            <p>At the time of the November journal club, some of the IRACDA scholars have already completed their two semesters of teaching, the pedagogy workshops, and the Scientist Teaching Science course but most are at some intermediate level of completion. For example, the three postdocs in my cohort have recently begun the pedagogy workshops but will not begin teaching until next fall. The mix of experiences and perspectives can help generate active discussions of the literature. Gathering together also serves to get all of the IRACDA scholars together on a regular basis, a small miracle with everyone's busy schedules.</p>
            <p>Although I haven't begun my teaching commitments I have previously given some lectures and TA'd for a semester in graduate school. I'm also currently helping with the Physical and Quantitative Biology graduate course at the Laufer Center at SBU. I presented three lectures for that course and I've been leading weekly recitations, writing and grading homework, and will be writing and grading the final exam. Helping with this class provides additional experience in teaching and I look forward to more next fall.</p>
            <p>It's early in my teaching career and I'm sure my experiences will change my outlook as I grow and spend more time in my role as an instructor. At this point, though, I wanted to present an article that examined an aspect of teaching that I hadn't considered much and that would also lead to good discussion in the journal club. The primary thesis of the article is that affect is key to learning and that research into this is still in the early phases so new methods are needed to understand how affective constructs like self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and science identity are related to student outcomes. Effective methods of measuring affect in the classroom will provide instructors additional tools to assess how the classroom environment is influencing different students, and allow instructors to institute changes that improve self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and science identity.</p>
            <p>The authors define the three affective constructs, demonstrate the importance of each on learning, and then provide examples of how different assessments have been used to study the role of each in learning. I followed a similar outline for my talk, and was happy that these points generated discussion amongst the group.</p>
            <p>I don't intend to go over all the details here, but essentially each of these affective constructs have been shown to be associated with improved outcomes and persistence in the field. In short, students that have belief in themselves, feel that they belong in science, and develop identity as a scientist perform better and are more likely to stay in their discipline. And that makes studying the role of affect in learning important to training the next generation of scientists.</p>
